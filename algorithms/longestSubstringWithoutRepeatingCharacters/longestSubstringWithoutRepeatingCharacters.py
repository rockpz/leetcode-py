'''********************************************************************************** 
* 
* Given a string, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters. 
* For example, the longest substring without repeating letters for "abcabcbb" is "abc", 
* which the length is 3. For "bbbbb" the longest substring is "b", with the length of 1.
*

'''
 * Idea:
 * 
 * Using a map store each char's index.
 * 
 * So, we can be easy to know the when duplication and the previous duplicated char's index.
 * 
 * Then we can take out the previous duplicated char, and keep tracking the maxiumn length.
