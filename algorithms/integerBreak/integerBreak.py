'''*************************************************************************************** 
 *
 * Given a positive integer n, break it into the sum of at least two positive integers 
 * and maximize the product of those integers. Return the maximum product you can get.
 * 
 * For example, given n = 2, return 1 (2 = 1 + 1); given n = 10, return 36 (10 = 3 + 3 
 * + 4).
 * 
 * Note: you may assume that n is not less than 2.
 * 
 *   There is a simple O(n) solution to this problem.
 *   You may check the breaking results of n ranging from 7 to 10 to discover the 
 * regularities.
 * 
 * Credits:Special thanks to @jianchao.li.fighter for adding this problem and creating 
 * all test cases.
