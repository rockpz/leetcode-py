'''*************************************************************************************** 
 *
 * Given an array of citations (each citation is a non-negative integer) of a 
 * researcher, write a function to compute the researcher's h-index.
 * 
 * According to the definition of h-index on Wikipedia: "A scientist has index h if h of
 * his/her N papers have at least h citations each, and the other N âˆ’ h papers have no
 * more than h citations each."
 * 
 * For example, given citations = [3, 0, 6, 1, 5], which means the researcher has 5 
 * papers in total and each of them had received 3, 0, 6, 1, 5 citations respectively.
 * Since the researcher has 3 papers with at least 3 citations each and the remaining 
 * two with no more than 3 citations each, his h-index is 3.
 * 
 * Note: If there are several possible values for h, the maximum one is taken as the 
 * h-index.
 *

 * Solutions
 * =========
 *
 * A simple solution would be to sort the vector and then run through it starting with
 * the last element. At every step we need to check whether this element is not less than
 * the remaining number of elements bigger than it(including itself) and all the values of
 * the other elements smaller than it are not more than that number. The h_index is this
 * number of elements bigger than it(including itself).
 * 
 * Time Complexity: O(N log N)
 * Space Complexity: O(1)
