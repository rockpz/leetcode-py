'''********************************************************************************** 
* 
* Implement next permutation, which rearranges numbers into the lexicographically next 
* greater permutation of numbers.
* 
* If such arrangement is not possible, it must rearrange it as the lowest possible order 
* (ie, sorted in ascending order).
* 
* The replacement must be in-place, do not allocate extra memory.
* 
* Here are some examples. Inputs are in the left-hand column and its corresponding outputs 
* are in the right-hand column.
*
*   1,2,3 → 1,3,2
*   3,2,1 → 1,2,3
*   1,1,5 → 1,5,1
*

 * Take a look the following continuous permutation, can you find the patern?
 *
 *    1 2 3 4
 *    1 2 4 3
 *    1 3 2 4
 *    1 3 4 2
 *    1 4 2 3
 *    1 4 3 2
 *    2 1 3 4
 *    ...
 *
 * The pattern can be descripted as below:
 *
 *    1) from n-1 to 0, find the first place [i-1] which num[i-1] < num[i]
 *    2) from n-1 to i, find the first number from n-1 to i which >= num[i-1]
 *    3) swap the 2) num with the num[i-1]
 *    4) sort the sub-array [i, n) //actuall sort is fine as well
 * 
 * For example:
 * 
 *     1 4 3 2   <-- 1) find the first place which num[i-1] < num[i]
 *     ^
 * 
 *     1 4 3 2   <-- 2) find the first number from n-1 to i which >= num[i-1]
 *     ^     ^  
 * 
 *     2 4 3 1   <-- 3) swap them
 *     ^     ^
 * 
 *     2 4 3 1   <-- 4) sort
 *       ^   ^
 *
 *     2 1 3 4   
 * 
 * Edge Case:
 *
 *     4 3 2 1, the next permutation is 1 2 3 4
