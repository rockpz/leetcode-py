'''********************************************************************************** 
* 
* Given a 2D board and a word, find if the word exists in the grid.
* 
* The word can be constructed from letters of sequentially adjacent cell, 
* where "adjacent" cells are those horizontally or vertically neighboring. 
* The same letter cell may not be used more than once.
* 
* For example,
* Given board = 
* 
* [
*   ["ABCE"],
*   ["SFCS"],
*   ["ADEE"]
* ]
* 
* word = "ABCCED", -> returns true,
* word = "SEE", -> returns true,
* word = "ABCB", -> returns false.
* 
*
