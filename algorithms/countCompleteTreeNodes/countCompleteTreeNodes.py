'''********************************************************************************** 
 * 
 * Given a complete binary tree, count the number of nodes.
 * 
 * Definition of a complete binary tree from Wikipedia:
 * http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_tree#Types_of_binary_trees
 *
 * In a complete binary tree every level, except possibly the last, is completely filled, 
 * and all nodes in the last level are as far left as possible. 
 * It can have between 1 and 2^h nodes inclusive at the last level h.
 *
